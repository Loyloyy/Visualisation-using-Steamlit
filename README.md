# Visualisation-using-Steamlit

This repository includes my kernel where I used Streamlit to do data visualisation. Streamlit is a veryuseful data visualisation tool which allows users to conduct data analyse and showcase onto a web application without any web experience.

The very unique aspect of Streamlist is that it allows the users to interact with the data, similar to a dashboard. This allows the users to select what kind of data or to narrow down their preferences accordingly.
